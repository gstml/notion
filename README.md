# notion

Light CSS adjustment for the Notion web interface with lower contrast and Mulish from GFonts for text.  
You can apply it in both Firefox and Chromium-based browsers using **StyleBot**.  
Doesn't work on second-level domains (i.e. when you're browsing somebody else's Notion), pretty obvious :))

It looks like this:
